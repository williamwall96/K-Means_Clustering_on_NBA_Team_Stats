# K-Means_Clustering_on_NBA_Team_Stats

This project is an exploratory unsupervised machine learning analysis focused on uncovering patterns and differences among NBA teams using team-level performance data from the 2014 to 2024 seasons. The primary objective is to investigate whether teams can be grouped into distinct clusters based on statistical profiles — and whether these clusters relate to playoff success.

The analysis centers on the K-Means clustering algorithm, which is applied to standardized team statistics to discover natural groupings of team archetypes. After selecting the optimal number of clusters using both the elbow method and silhouette analysis, teams are clustered and evaluated based on feature characteristics, cluster composition, and playoff performance.

Additional analyses explore how these clusters evolve over time, revealing broader shifts in team strategy — such as the NBA's transition toward faster-paced, three-point-heavy offenses. Emphasis is placed on interpretability, using visualizations, feature comparisons, and descriptive labels to make sense of the resulting clusters.

This project highlights how K-Means clustering can be used to extract insights from unlabeled sports data and illustrate the evolution of team identities in the NBA.
